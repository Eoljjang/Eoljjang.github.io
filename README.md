**Question 1:** What are some beenfits of using a static site generator? Some disadvantages?
*Advanges:*
- It's REALLY fast to load as there are no need to query databases, or generate pages (it's all already there).
- Doesn't need server-side coding.
- Doesn't have a database (security isn't a problem, as there's no info anyway).
- Works great with version control.

*Disadvantages*
- Changing ANY content = have to do a full deploy of the site. This may get redundant over time.
- Not great for dynamic features -> They're static. They show what data is available at the current time. Can't accept dynamic data.
